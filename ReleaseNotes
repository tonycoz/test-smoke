ReleaseNotes - These are the Release Notes for 1.16_30

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is a development snapshot! (posing as v1.17_RC1)
(Sorry, but it may still have bugs or be incomplete)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I have done a lot of refactoring and wrote loads of new code and
documentation.

=over 4

=item 1

F<smokeperl.pl> is the new way to smoke. It is a wrapper script around
good ol' F<mktest.pl> and F<mkovz.pl>

It also uses the backends to B<synctree.pl> and B<mailrpt.pl>

=item 2

F<configsmoke.pl> helps you create a (mandatory) configuration for
F<smokeperl.pl>. This configuration is stored in a separate file, so
that it is possible to have different configurations.

One can think of different perl versions or different compiler
versions.

=item 3

New ways to sync the source-tree (see L<synctree.pl> and
L<Test::Smoke::Syncer>).

=item 4

Distribution now contains Mail::Sendmail (esp. for Win32)

=item 5

-Uuseperlio will now only do one (1) testrun and it's back in 
F<perlcurrent.cfg>

=item 6

An implementation of Nick Clark's 'Hardlink Forest', with the extra
B<< --forest <directory> >> option to B<mktest.pl>. This will change
the way to B<make distclean> to another (hopefully faster).

=item 7

The subject of the message  containing the report has changed:

 Smoke [perlversion] <patch> <summary> <os> - <osvers> (<arch>/<cpus>)

=item 8

If your platform supports B<UTF-8 locales> you will now be able to do
an extra pass of B<make test> with B<$ENV{LC_ALL}> set to such a
locale.

=item 9

All the backends now have a front end script (F<synctree.pl>,
F<patchtree.pl>, F<mailrpt.pl> and F<W32Configure.pl>

=item 10

There now is a B<--smartsmoke> option that will exit after the
SYNCTREE step if the the patchlevel is the same as before.

=item 11

Some hacks are in place to support the smoking of perl-5.6.2 to be, as
it doesn't need the extended PerlIO testing we use for 5.8+.

=item 12

To configure Test::Smoke for smoking perl-5.6.x(MAINT):

    $ perl configsmoke.pl -p smoke56x

To configre Test::Smoke for smoking perl-5.8.x(MAINT):

    $ perl configsmoke.pl -p smoke58x

=item 13

I think I finally got B<make install> to do what I want.
