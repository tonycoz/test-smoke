since v1.18.

Major changes since 1.18

=over 4

=item 1

I finally got around to rewriting F<mkovz.pl> and replaced it with
L<Test::Smoke::Reporter> and decided to use <mailrpt.pl> as the new
front-end.

=item 2

The new reports have better hardware detection, with many thanks to
Merijn Brand (most osses), Campo Weijerman (AIX), Allen Smith (IRIX),
Alan Burlison (Solaris).

The compiler info is now logged after each Configure, so this is will be
available in reports even though the last Configure failed.

=item 3

After "many" requests, the old stuff (F<mktest.pl>, F<mkovz.pl> etc)
is now B<gone> (although I had planned the 1.20)!

=item 4

F<smokestatus.pl> tries to give a better guesstimate for ETA.
