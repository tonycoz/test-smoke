=head1 NAME

ReleaseNotes - These are the Release Notes for 1.20

=head1 SYNOPSIS

These are the major changes since version 1.19

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Thanks to Bernd Ulmann for giving me access to his VAX and the help of
the vmsperl community, I have added support for OpenVMS.

Major changes since 1.19

=over 4

=item 1

C<Test::Smoke::SysInfo> is a work in progress. Some more tweaking for
Solaris was done with the help of Alan Burlison and Davis Woolger.

=item 2

I order to support systems without C<rsync(1)> access, I have added
C<Test::Smoke::FTPClient> that syncs source-trees with Net::FTP from
the ActiveState ftp repository. It is slow, but gets the job done.

=item 3

A lot of filename/directoryname issues with VMS were resolved.

=item 4

A new way to get testresults directly from "make test_harness" was
introduced to help VMS (and perhaps Win32).
