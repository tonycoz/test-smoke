=item 1

Jarkko suggested a timeout mechanism so that smokes are stopped on a
specific time or after a specified duration.

    {killtime} eq '07:30' stops the smoke at 07:30 (AM)
    {killtime} eq '+9:30' stop after 9.5 hours

(this change was integrated into 1.17.02 MAINT)

=item 2

L<Test::Smoke::BuildCFG> is a new interface for handling build
configurations. This OO interface will serialise the parsed build
configurations and give you the ability to itterate over them.

=item 3

L<Test::Smoke::Smoker> is a new interface for running a smoke
cycle. It basically replaces the inner works of F<mktest.pl>.
