Test::Smoke roadmap - Roadmap for Test::Smoke development

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This document states my intensions for the development of
L<Test::Smoke>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When I took over the maintenance of the B<Test::Smoke> package it was
at version 1.13. Shortly after that I released version 1.16 that fixed
some stuff that was closely related to changes in the perl-sources.


=head2 Test::Smoke 1.17

The intention for version 1.17 is to pull development for all
supported Operating Systems together and develop a more userfriendly
suite.

On release the source-tree for Test::Smoke will be split off to have a
maintenance branch (1.17.xx) and the maintenance releases will be
numbered accordingly.

=head2 Test::Smoke 1.18

The intention for version 1.18 is to untangle the build configurations
mess and clean up F<mktest.pl>. Development (alpha) releases will start
at version 1.17_50.

=head2 Test::Smoke 1.19

The intention for version 1.19 is to untangle the reports
mess and clean up F<mkovz.pl>. Development (alpha) releases will
start at version 1.18_50.

=head2 Test::Smoke 1.20

1.20 had some features added (compiler messages, VMS support) and bugs
fixed.

=head2 Test::Smoke 1.21

I want to release more often and increase versions more often, so that
CPAN will install the latest version.

=head2 Test::Smoke 2.00

The intention for 2.00 is to restructure the configuration
stuff. Development releases will start at version 1.99.

=head1 Test::Smoke repository

The Test::Smoke sources are kept in a publicly accessable
Subversion repository from which anyone can check them out.
